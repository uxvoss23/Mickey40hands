Good. You’re asking for standard, industry-level testing categories — not just your feature logic.

Here’s the clean list of general tests professional teams run to catch bugs, weaknesses, and breakpoints in web/mobile apps.

You can hand this to your developer and say:

“Run full coverage across these categories.”

🧪 1️⃣ Unit Testing

Tests individual functions.

Catches:

Broken logic

Wrong calculations

Edge-case failures

Example:

Time math

Sorting logic

Permission flags

Frameworks:

Jest

Mocha

PyTest

JUnit

🧪 2️⃣ Integration Testing

Tests multiple components working together.

Catches:

API misfires

Database write failures

Broken workflow chains

Example:
Cancellation → Gap mode → Message send → Schedule update.

🧪 3️⃣ End-to-End (E2E) Testing

Simulates a real user flow.

Catches:

UI breaks

Button failures

Route calculation issues

Broken confirmations

Tools:

Cypress

Playwright

Selenium

This is critical for your mobile-first app.

🧪 4️⃣ Regression Testing

Re-tests the entire system after new code is added.

Catches:

New updates breaking old features

Hidden ripple effects

Every deployment should run regression tests.

🧪 5️⃣ Load Testing (Performance Testing)

Tests system under heavy usage.

Catches:

Slowdowns

Crashes

API bottlenecks

Database overload

Tools:

JMeter

k6

Locust

You should simulate:

10k customers

100 concurrent gap-fill requests

🧪 6️⃣ Stress Testing

Push system beyond limits.

Catches:

Failure handling

Recovery issues

Memory leaks

You want to know how it fails.

🧪 7️⃣ Security Testing

Extremely important for CRM + customer data.

Catches:

SQL injection

XSS attacks

Authentication flaws

Data exposure

Improper role permissions

Tests include:

Penetration testing

Vulnerability scanning

Role-based access audits

🧪 8️⃣ Race Condition Testing

For real-time systems like yours.

Catches:

Double confirmations

Duplicate scheduling

Simultaneous database writes

Slot locking failures

Must include atomic database transactions.

🧪 9️⃣ API Testing

Ensures backend endpoints behave correctly.

Catches:

Incorrect data responses

Timeout errors

Invalid status codes

Data corruption

🧪 1️⃣0️⃣ Cross-Browser & Device Testing

Since mobile-first:

Test on:

iPhone Safari

Android Chrome

Desktop Chrome

Desktop Safari

Edge

Catches:

Layout breaks

Touch issues

CSS rendering inconsistencies

🧪 1️⃣1️⃣ Accessibility Testing

Optional but professional.

Catches:

Broken tab navigation

Screen reader incompatibility

Contrast issues

🧪 1️⃣2️⃣ Data Integrity Testing

Especially important for your routing system.

Catches:

Incorrect schedule updates

Jobs duplicating

Ownership transfer bugs

Incomplete record updates

🧪 1️⃣3️⃣ Backup & Recovery Testing

Tests:

Database restore process

Failure recovery

Rollback system

You need this if scaling.

🧪 1️⃣4️⃣ Logging & Monitoring Tests

Ensure:

Errors are logged

Alerts trigger

You can trace failures

Crash reporting works

Without logging, you’re blind.

🔥 What You Should Tell Your Developer

“I want full unit, integration, regression, load, race condition, security, API, and E2E testing before launch. Also confirm atomic slot locking and role-based permission security.”

If they hesitate, that’s a red flag.
